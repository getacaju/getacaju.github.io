### Our Story

A typical evening meal for Mithra always included copious amounts of yogurt. Yogurt was the centerpiece of Mithra's meals until one day she decided to go vegan. Her concern for animal welfare was increasingly at odds with her diet, so on her birthday in 2015 she pledged to turn vegan and become a more mindful consumer. The challenge now was to find a plant-based substitute for dairy yogurt. She tried several branded plant-based yogurts but none of them cut it for this yogurt purist. They were either too watery or had a flat taste. This spurred her to create her own yogurt.

After many months of false starts and bad starters she developed a cashew-based recipe that she was happy eating all the time. Having tasted success in yogurt making she started entertaining the prospect of sharing her creation with a broader audience. Thus was born Acajú, which has so far delighted the palate of hundreds of patrons. Through Acajú, Mithra wants to provide a mindful, tasty experience for anyone, one tub at a time!
