### Our Story

A typical evening meal for Mithra included copious amounts of yogurt along with whatever else was prepared for dinner. Yogurt was the centerpiece of Mithra's meals until one day she decided to go vegan. Her concern for animal welfare was increasingly at odds with her diet, so on her birthday in 2015 she pledged to turn vegan and become a more mindful consumer. Now, the challenge arose of how she could substitute dairy yogurt in her diet. She tried several branded plant-based yogurts but none of them cut it for this yogurt snob. They were either too watery or had a flat taste. This spurred her to create her own yogurt.

After many months of false starts and bad starters she developed a cashew-based recipe that she was happy eating day in and day out. Having tasted success in yogurt making she started entertaining the prospect of sharing her creation with a broader audience. Thus was born Acajú, which has so far delighted the palate of hundreds of patrons. Through Acajú Mithra wants to provide a mindful, tasty experience for everyone, one tub at a time!
